# RoadGraph
Mapping Application

A mapping application with the ability to provide and visualize routes from one point to another on a map.
The folder src/roadgraph contains the following implementations:
- the breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path on the graph,
- Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path through a weighted graph,
- A Star search algorithm which optimizes Dijkstra's algorithm.

The code for visualization of algorithms is developed by US San Diego Programming MOOC team 
(source: https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-data-structures).

To launch the application, run src/application/MapApp.java.
